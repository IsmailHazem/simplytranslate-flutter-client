<p>This app is an alternative front-end to GoogleTranslate, but doesn't directly connect to it.<br>
    It works as follows:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Text is submitted from you the user and sent to a random SimplyTranslate instance (server).</li>
    <li>This instance will request that data from GoogleTranslate.</li>
    <li>GoogleTranslate will send the result back to that instance.</li>
    <li>That instance will send the result back to you.</li>
</ol>

<p>This way GoogleTranslate won't know your identity. Auto selecting a random instance (default mode) each request
    will obfuscate and spread your data more between instances so nothing will be linked easily as it's not in a centralized database.
