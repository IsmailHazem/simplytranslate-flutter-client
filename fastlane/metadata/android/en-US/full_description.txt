<p>Normally you would use GoogleTranslate. Problem is either you'll be signed in with your google account, from the same
    ip as your google account, or some other factors. Translations may be tied to your identity. Sometimes there is no
    problem with that. Other times there is. Like when browsing wikipedia. We'll know what diseases you have, political,
    religious, sexual etc... Translation is a bit worse.

<p><a href="https://metalune.xyz/">Metalune</a> created a proxy server application for GoogleTranslate. You connect to
    one of the so called "<a href="https://simple-web.metalune.xyz/projects/simplytranslate.html">SimplyTranslate</a>"
    instances(servers). Request data to be translated. The instance will request that data from GoogleTranslate, and
    give it back to you. Only the instance's identity was exposed. If multiple people used the instance, you'll be
    obfuscated with them. Using a different instance each time will obfuscate more.</p>

<p>Metalune created a <a href="https://translate.metalune.xyz/">web client</a> for
    SimplyTranslate, and I created a mobile client. Pros of mine is if you want to connect to a different instance each
    time, you won't have to visit a different website. Just select one of the available ones in instance selector
    button, let the app choose a random one every launch, or a custom one. All of that without leaving your lovely app.

<p>No Instant Camera, Document, or Speech Translation at the time. Those should be implemented first on the proxy
    server. Then on the client apps. I'll try to help with that.</p>
